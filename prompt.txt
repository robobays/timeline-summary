Examine the data in the user input. It represents the timeline for a StarCraft II match between two players.
"stats" objects give statistics about the resources and army forces of player 1 and player 2 in snapshots every 160 game loops (this corresponds to about 7 seconds of real time).
"fight" objects give statistics about the army units and structures the two players possessed, created and lost every minute of real time.
The timeline contains data until the end of the match. The player with no (or very few) structures at the last "fight" stats is the player who lost the match.

Give me scores and a summary of the match as a JSON object in this form:
{
  "domination": <domination score>,
  "swings": <swings score>,
  "action": <action score>,
  "growth": <growth score>,
  "timing": <timing score>,
  "transitions": <transitions score>,
  "harrassment": <harrassment score>,
  "comeback": <comeback score>,
  "summary": <short description of the match that outlines its features without spoilers about which player won the match>,
}.

The scores are:
* domination - One-sidedness score. The average difference of value of active forces between the two players is strongly in favor of one of the players.
* swings - Back and forth score. The difference of value of active forces between the two players changes in favor of one player and the other throughout the game.
* action - Constant engagement score. Reflects the frequency and magnitude of value of units killed.
* growth - Economic growth score. Reflects the steadiness of increase in collected resources and built structures.
* timing - Timing attacks score. Spike in active forces shortly followed by large drop in opponents value.
* transitions - Technology transitions score. Mix of created unit types changes after  major fights or stalemates.
* harrassment - Harrassment score. Small but frequent losses.
* comeback - Comeback score. Significant reversal of domination.

All scores are from 1 to 10.

Respond with the JSON object without any additional text or markers.
